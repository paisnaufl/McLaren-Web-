                    <h1>OFFICIAL CASIST FOR FORMULA 1 2023</h1>
                    <p>The car made its competitive début at the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix. It was driven by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, Norris for his fifth season with McLaren and Piastri in his rookie year. The initial specification of the MCL60 was generally seen as uncompetitive, with poor aerodynamic performance and tyre degradation. Its poor performance led to Key's departure from the team in March 2023, and he was replaced by a new structure of three technical directors. Peter Prodromou and Neil Houldey took over development of the MCL60. An upgrade package delivered at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, the fourth round of the season, was the final development produced under Key's leadership.

                </div>
                <div class="text">
                <p>Beginning with the Austrian Grand Prix, the ninth round of the championship, the new technical leadership delivered a significant upgrade package to the car, which contributed to a marked improvement in the team's results. Another substantial package was delivered at the Singapore Grand Prix. Once the initial Austrian–British package had been fitted, the MCL60 went on to achieve nine podiums and three fastest laps in Grands Prix. Further, the car achieved two sprint poles and four sprint podiums including one victory. The change in design direction has been described as effective and successful, and appeared to influence the development of several other teams.

                <h3><span>Rear Wing</span></h3>
                <p>The rear wing is also vastly different to previous generations. The chief goal is to reduce the wake of dirty air behind the car. The first step towards this is to get rid of rear wing end plates. These are great for generating downforce, but also for generating dirty air that disrupts the stability of a following car. The new rear wings curved shape not only removes endplates, but its curved shape also creates an airflow structure that collects wake from the rear wheels and funnels it into the flow coming up from the rear diffuser, helping to fire the lot high into the air, causing less instability for a following car.</p>

                <h3><span>Underbody and Diffuser</span></h3>
                <p>The biggest change with this new generation of cars lies in how they generate downforce. Designed to reduce the wake of ‘dirty’ air that hampers following cars, 2022 F1 cars zero in on the floor as the source of downforce and in effect the sport has brought back ground effect, last seen on cars in 1982. Out go the flat floors we’ve been used to for decades and in come two long tunnels that channel airflow under the car and back to the rear diffuser. The raked diffuser will fire dirty air higher than with previous cars so the wake’s energy will dissipate over a longer time before impacting a following car.</p>

                <h3><span>Front Wings</span></h3>
                <p>In the hybrid era front wings were an area of huge focus for teams and increasingly complex as teams tried to find greater aerodynamic benefits. The front wing was routinely simplified in the final years of the last generation of cars, but for 2022 it has been totally reimagined. A four-element wing is attached directly to the nose and features a very simple endplate. The idea is that with the floor generating the bulk of downforce, the front wing doesn’t have to work as hard and the simplified version will also be less sensitive to the turbulent wake from a car in front.</p>

                <h3><span>Wheel Covers and Winglets</span></h3>
                <p>A major area of aero development for teams in recent years has been using airflow through the wheels to generate downforce and, once again, to channel dirty air outboard of the car, adding to a turbulent wake that causes instability in a following car. To remove that temptation from designers, F1 has chosen to implement wheel covers that physically prevent air being channelled through the wheels. The new rim covers are tightly defined however, so teams won’t get to play with the design to channel that turbulent air. The new cars also get a small winglet over the new 18” tyres this season. These are designed to help control the wake coming off the front tyres and direct it away from the rear wing.</p>

                <h3><span>18" Tyres</span></h3>
                <p>After more than half a century of 13-inch tyres, in 2022 the size increases to 18 inches. Featuring new profiles, compounds and construction, the new rubber has been designed to have a wider working range than the 13” tyres and as a result, overheating is limited and degradation is reduced, which in theory should allow drivers to race closer for longer. The new lower profile should also reduce sidewall deflection changes and the wake effect that occurs as a result, again to the benefit of close racing. Additionally, new temperatures are introduced for the tyre blankets. All tyres will now be heated to 70 degrees, rather than 100 degrees at the front and 80 degrees at the rear, as was the case previously.</p>
